Yes, the **step-by-step plan above matches RabbitSign’s API documentation** for sending arbitrary PDFs for signature. Here’s a breakdown of how each step aligns with the official docs you provided:

---

### **Step 1: Get an Upload URL**
- **API Doc Reference:**  
  > **Get an upload URL for each local file to be included in the folder**  
  > POST /api/v1/upload-url  
  > ...returns {"uploadUrl":"..."}
- **Plan:**  
  - POST to `/api/v1/upload-url` with the required headers.
  - Receive a pre-signed S3 URL.

---

### **Step 2: Upload the PDF**
- **API Doc Reference:**  
  > **Upload each local file to RabbitSign using the pre-signed S3 URL returned above**  
  > PUT (to the returned S3 URL)  
  > Content-Type: binary/octet-stream
- **Plan:**  
  - PUT your PDF file to the returned S3 URL with `Content-Type: binary/octet-stream`.

---

### **Step 3: Create a Folder (Signing Request)**
- **API Doc Reference:**  
  > **Create a folder**  
  > POST /api/v1/folder  
  > ...reference uploaded file(s) and, for each signer, specify their name, email and fields (SIGNATURE, INITIALS, TEXTBOX, CHECKBOX).
- **Plan:**  
  - POST to `/api/v1/folder` with a JSON body referencing the uploaded file URL and specifying signer info and signature fields.
  - Use the required headers and include today’s date in the body.

---

### **Step 4: Poll for Status or Download**
- **API Doc Reference:**  
  > **Get folder signing status**  
  > GET /api/v1/folder/<FolderId>  
  > ...downloadUrl can be used to download a zip file containing the signed document(s) and the audit trail.
- **Plan:**  
  - GET `/api/v1/folder/:folderId` to check status and retrieve the download URL when available.

---

### **Headers and Authentication**
- **API Doc Reference:**  
  > Each API request must have the following 3 HTTP headers:  
  > - x-rabbitsign-api-time-utc  
  > - x-rabbitsign-api-key-id  
  > - x-rabbitsign-api-signature  
  > ...signature is SHA-512 of "HTTP_METHOD PATH UTC_TIME SECRET_KEY"
- **Plan:**  
  - All requests in the plan include these headers, with the signature generated as described.

---

### **Field Structure**
- **API Doc Reference:**  
  > For each signer, specify their name, email, and fields (SIGNATURE, INITIALS, TEXTBOX, CHECKBOX).  
  > Use position to specify a field’s location.
- **Plan:**  
  - The plan includes a `signerInfo` object with signer email, name, and an array of fields with type, id, and position.

---

**In summary:**  
The pseudocode and step-by-step plan are fully consistent with RabbitSign’s API documentation for sending arbitrary PDFs for signature.
